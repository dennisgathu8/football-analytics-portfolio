## ⚽ Why This Portfolio Matters for Pro Clubs
In modern football, especially within the **KPL and East African regions**, the gap between high-performance and average performance is the ability to process data at speed. I build systems that don't just "report" what happened, but "predict" how to win.

### 🏗️ Core Competencies
- **Automated Scouting:** Production-grade pipelines that ingest Metrica and StatsBomb data autonomously.
- **Tactical "Digital Twins":** Simulating match scenarios (e.g., high-press outcomes) using Clojure's immutable data structures.
- **Market ROI:** Leveraging 1.5 years of professional betting BI to identify undervalued talent (Moneyball for Africa).

## 📂 Case Studies & Key Projects

### 1. [AgentRZA: The Scouting Engine](https://github.com/dennisgathu8/AgentRZA)
**Problem:** Scouting departments are overwhelmed by manual data entry and inconsistent metrics.
**Solution:** A multi-agent system that autonomously fetches, cleans, and enriches match data with xG and Pitch Control metrics.
- **Club Impact:** Reduces technical scouting overhead by 80%.
- **Tech:** Python, LangGraph, DuckDB, Fernet Encryption.

### 2. [heinze: The Tactical Oracle](https://github.com/dennisgathu8/heinze)
**Problem:** Coaches cannot test tactical adjustments in real-time during a match.
**Solution:** A real-time tactical simulation tool that identifies defensive vulnerabilities and suggests shape corrections.
- **Club Impact:** Empowers the "Touchline Assistant" with data-backed defensive adjustments.
- **Tech:** Clojure, Parallel Simulation, Vector-based Time Travel.

### 3. [house-hedge: Proven Betting Intelligence (Transferable to Scouting ROI)](https://github.com/dennisgathu8/house-hedge)
**Problem:** High-value player recruitment is often based on emotion rather than objective ROI.
**Solution:** A platform built and run in a live betting environment → exact multi-agent + xG + ROI logic now being adapted for player valuation and recruitment optimization (Moneyball for KPL). Dedicated scouting fork in progress.
- **Club Impact:** Optimized recruitment budget by targeting players with high "Tactical Upside" vs Market Value.
- **Tech:** Clojure, Multi-Agent Risk Management.

## 🇰🇪 The East African Vision
As the son of a professional Kenyan player and coach, I am building the infrastructure for the next generation of **Harambee Stars** and **KPL** dominance. I am bridging the gap between elite European tech and regional football realities.
